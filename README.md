Power To The People (PTTP) is a direct democracy system. It's a Python lambda function connected to a react js web page that allows users to propose, amend, and vote on laws with equal power of initiative and without elected representatives.

The objective is to build a website that is nice to use on both desktop and mobile to connect to the backend and deploy it on AWS in 2023!

This project is an exciting experiment for me and could be used for the internal democracy of a university in Paris, France from September 2023 if we can build the front end and deploy on AWS by then.

Obviously, feel free to implement anything in this repo to set up a direct democracy system with your friends, in your school, company, university, union, or commune. :)
